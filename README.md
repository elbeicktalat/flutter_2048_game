# game_2048

A simple implementation of 2048 puzzle game ðŸŽ®, using pure flutter.

## About project

This project is a hard coding of a puzzle game, so I didn't care about responsive design, even the design at self, so the only thing I had cared about is the logic behind some thing like this.

Maybe in the future I'll add some animation and makeing this project responsive and adaptive.
